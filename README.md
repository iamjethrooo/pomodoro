# Pomodoro Clock
A web version of a Pomodoro clock.<br>
From [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/pairing-project)<br>
This was supposed to be a pair project but I didn't have anyone to pair with, so I made it on my own.
